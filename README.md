Date: 4 - 9 Nov 2025

Venue: Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC)
## Background
This festival is a big event to share new ideas and make learning easy for everyone. Its goal is to make Malaysia a center for smart discussions and new inventions. It brings together leaders, experts, and the public to talk about solutions for problems in the country and the world. The festival hopes to create a society that loves knowledge and big ideas. It's also a place to celebrate Malaysia's successes and show off Putrajaya as a "City of Ideas."

## Reflection
Me and some of my classmates attended the Putrajaya Festival of Ideas on 5th November 2025. There were many other university students who attended this event as well, like those from UM, UKM, UPM, UiTM, UTeM, and so on. To be honest, I thought I was just going there to be a passive listener, but this festival has proven me wrong in so many ways.

In class, we learn a lot of things, but we don't always know why they matter. At the festival, listening to people actually working with AI and green tech, I finally understood why my classes are important and what specific skills I need to focus on to get a good job later. It turned my worries into a clear to-do list. It was also just really inspiring. Being around so many smart and passionate people made me excited about my own possibilities. It showed me that what I'm learning now isn't just for tests but rather a tool I can use to actually do cool things and be part of Malaysia's future story. So, I now have a much better idea of what to learn and why, and that’s a pretty amazing feeling.

Special thanks to the Minister of Higher Education for initiating this amazing experience.
